# Smartphone-Survey-Partworth-Conjoint-Analysis

## Introduction
This document provides the analysis for the MKT618 Final Group Project. The goal is to identify the target market for the iPhone 14 and estimate consumers' willingness to pay for key smartphone features.

## Goals
The analysis addresses the following:
1. Understand smartphone purchasing and usage behavior.
2. Analyze perceptions of different smartphone brands.
3. Evaluate willingness-to-pay for key features.

### Subtasks
- Awareness of smartphone brands: Frequency Analysis.
- Familiarity with smartphone brands.
- Primary smartphone brand used.
- Overall perception ratings (conjoint analysis).
- Daily phone usage and replacement frequency.

## Factor extraction with rotation

The table displays the factor loadings for each variable across four factors (RC1, RC2, RC3, and RC4). These loadings help us understand which variables are most associated with each factor.

Based on the above result, the factors can be named as follows:
RC1: Performance & Features
RC2: Design & Aesthetics
RC3: Photography & Camera
RC4: Versatility & Screen Experience


## Clusters
We decided on 5 clusters based on the elbow plot.

Factor Analysis aims to reduce the dimensionality of the data by identifying latent constructs (e.g., RC1, RC2, etc.). These constructs represent groups of related variables (e.g., Performance, Design).

Cluster Analysis groups observations (e.g., respondents) into clusters based on similarities in their factor scores. It does not directly depend on the number of factors but uses the factor scores to group similar responses.

Cluster 1: Practical users who value versatility and performance while deprioritizing design.
Cluster 2: Disengaged or price-sensitive users with low interest across all factors.
Cluster 3: Balanced users who value design, aesthetics, and overall performance.
Cluster 4: Photography enthusiasts who prioritize camera features over versatility or design.
Cluster 5: Performance-oriented users with a strong focus on functionality and less interest in photography.
